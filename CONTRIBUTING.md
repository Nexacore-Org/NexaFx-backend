## 🌱 Branching Strategy

- Use the `main` branch for production-ready code.
- All new features or fixes should be based off the latest `main` branch.

### Naming Conventions

| Type       | Example Branch Name              |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Feature    | `feature/transactions-export`    |
| Fix        | `fix/auth-role-guard`            |
| Refactor   | `refactor/db-service`            |
| Chore      | `chore/update-deps`              |

## 🧪 Writing Tests

- Include unit or e2e tests for your changes when applicable.
- Use Jest and Supertest for testing.
- Run tests before pushing:

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
